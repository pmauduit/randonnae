== Randonnae

Randonnae (maybe from Latin language, should signify something like "Hiking",
but not sure ...) aims to be a Ruby On Rails application to nicely displays
your treks onto a slippy map, by uploading a zip file containing photos and a
GPX file.


== Why such an app ?

Because I was unhappy with viking desktop application (which is great anyway),
but I could not manage to have it printing my pictures as I wanted.

And ... because I just switched job and my next tasks would involve ruby / ruby
on rails, and I still don't know anything about the marvelous but huge world
around the ruby community.

== Aknowledgements

Francois, because I'm squatting his own server, Pierre for all the wonderful
treks we did in the Alps, Camptocamp for giving me some hints around geospatial
and computer science, and all the others I forgot ...
